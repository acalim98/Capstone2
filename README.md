The first image I chose is a picture of a mountain range, with a hiker standing at the top of one of the peaks. The sky is clear and blue, and the sunlight is shining on the mountain, giving it a beautiful and serene look. The second image is a picture of a trail winding through a dense forest, with the trees and ferns creating a canopy overhead. The trail is illuminated by the sunlight filtering through the trees, giving the scene a warm and inviting feel.

Linking the arrays to the drop-down menu for the mountains list is a useful piece of JavaScript, as it allows users to easily select the mountain they want to learn more about. This is a great way to make the website user-friendly and to provide users with the information they are looking for. It also allows you to easily update the website with new mountains and information, without having to manually update each page. Overall, this is a great addition to your website and will definitely enhance the user experience.
