# Capstone2
For my capstone 2 parks page I've kept a simple sleek website layout, encorpeeating pictures that match a hikers theme. I wanted to present my website as a theme that expresses allot for hikers and scienic viewing visitors. I implemented images that match a hikers theme.

Here are some of the two images I choose that match the theme of my website.
One inteeesting peice of JS I would say is linking all the arrays to the drop down for my mountains list.
